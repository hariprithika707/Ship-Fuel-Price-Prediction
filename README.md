Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting fuel consumption for ships based on various operational and environmental factors. By predicting fuel usage, it helps optimize ship routes, reduce fuel costs, and improve overall operational efficiency. The project leverages machine learning models, primarily regression, to analyze historical data and forecast future fuel consumption.

Features
Fuel Consumption Prediction: Accurate fuel consumption estimation using regression models.
Data-Driven Insights: Provides insights into how different factors like speed, weight, and weather conditions influence fuel usage.
Operational Efficiency: Helps optimize ship operations by enabling data-backed decision-making.
Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For implementing regression models.
File Structure
The following files are included in this repository:

bash
Copy code
/fuel-consumption-prediction
│
├── ship_fuel_sih.py          # Main script for fuel consumption prediction
├── README.md                 # Project documentation
├── requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
└── data                      # Folder for datasets (optional)
Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fuel-consumption-prediction.git
cd fuel-consumption-prediction
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure your dataset is available in the correct format (e.g., CSV) for prediction.

Usage
Running the script:

To run the script and predict fuel consumption, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python ship_fuel_sih.py
Modifying input data:

The script uses features such as speed, weight, and environmental conditions to predict fuel consumption. You can modify the input data in the dataset for different predictions.

Example
Here is a simple example of loading the dataset, training a regression model, and predicting fuel consumption:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Initialize and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(data[['speed', 'weight']], data['fuel_consumption'])

# Predict fuel consumption
predicted_fuel = model.predict([[20, 1500]])  # Example input (speed: 20, weight: 1500)
print(predicted_fuel)
Future Enhancements
Integrate real-time environmental data such as weather conditions to improve prediction accuracy.
Explore more advanced machine learning models like Random Forest or Neural Networks.
Create a web interface for easier input and fuel consumption prediction.
